Good morning, team. Are we on track with the new landing page copy?

[Mike • 9:02 AM]  
Morning, Sara. I’m finalizing the CTAs now and will send it over to Design by 10:00 AM.

[Aisha • 9:03 AM]  
Thanks, Mike. Once that’s in, I can set up the Google Analytics event tracking.

[Rahul • 9:05 AM]  
Quick heads-up: I spotted an issue with the mobile navigation on iOS—submenus aren’t accessible via swipe. Has anyone else encountered this?

[Chen • 9:06 AM]  
I tested on Android and it worked fine. Let me check on an iPhone simulator now.

[Chen • 9:08 AM]  
Confirmed. The touch event isn’t propagating correctly. I’ll prepare a hotfix and push it by lunchtime.

[Sara • 9:10 AM]  
Great. Can we schedule a brief QA session at 1:00 PM to verify the fix and confirm the social links?

[Mike • 9:11 AM]  
I’ll be there—and I’ll bring coffee.

[Aisha • 9:12 AM]  
I’ll handle analytics and SEO checks. If everything looks good, we’re clear for tomorrow’s deploy.

[Rahul • 9:13 AM]  
Also, the client requested a small tweak: please reduce the header logo size by 10%. They feel it’s a bit too large.

[Chen • 9:15 AM]  
No problem—I’ll include that in the hotfix branch as well.

[Sara • 9:16 AM]  
Perfect. Thanks, everyone. Let’s aim for a smooth rollout!

[All • 9:17 AM]
